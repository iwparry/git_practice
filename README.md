Introductory GitHub lesson


### Git Commands
Below are some commands you will often use when making changes to a repository and pushing those changes
-`git status` - not necessary but useful to spot what files have been changed and what is ready to be committed
- `git add .` - `.` represents all the files in the repo that have been changed
- `git commit -m "descriptive message"` - records file snapshots permanently (what you make with `git add` 
- `git push -u origin main`- Uploads all file commits on your local machine to GitHub, in this case to the main branch
